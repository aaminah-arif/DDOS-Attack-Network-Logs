# üåê Network Traffic Dataset for KNN Classification

## üìñ Overview
This dataset contains approximately **2.1 million labeled network log entries** that capture various types of network traffic and attacks. The goal is to classify network traffic using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm. In this version of the dataset, a **shortened subset** will be used for model training and evaluation.

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset includes labeled network logs that categorize traffic into **five classes**:

- **Normal**: Benign network traffic
- **UDP-Flood**: Denial of Service (DoS) attack using UDP packets
- **Smurf**: Denial of Service (DoS) attack involving ICMP packets
- **SIDDOS**: Simulated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
- **HTTP-FLOOD**: Denial of Service (DoS) attack targeting HTTP services

Each record in the dataset contains attributes related to network traffic, including packet details, node information, and traffic characteristics.

## üìã Attributes
The dataset contains the following attributes:

```
- SRC_ADD (numeric): Source address of the packet
- DES_ADD (numeric): Destination address of the packet
- PKT_ID (numeric): Unique packet identifier
- FROM_NODE (numeric): Source node identifier
- TO_NODE (numeric): Destination node identifier
- PKT_TYPE (categorical): Type of packet (e.g., tcp, ack, cbr, ping)
- PKT_SIZE (numeric): Size of the packet
- FLAGS (categorical): Flags associated with the packet
- FID (numeric): Flow identifier
- SEQ_NUMBER (numeric): Sequence number of the packet
- NUMBER_OF_PKT (numeric): Total number of packets in a session
- NUMBER_OF_BYTE (numeric): Total number of bytes in a session
- NODE_NAME_FROM (categorical): Name of the source node
- NODE_NAME_TO (categorical): Name of the destination node
- PKT_IN (numeric): Incoming packets count
- PKT_OUT (numeric): Outgoing packets count
- PKT_R (numeric): Packet rate
- PKT_DELAY_NODE (numeric): Delay at the node level
- PKT_RATE (numeric): Overall packet rate
- BYTE_RATE (numeric): Byte transmission rate
- PKT_AVG_SIZE (numeric): Average packet size
- UTILIZATION (numeric): Network utilization percentage
- PKT_DELAY (numeric): Overall packet delay
- PKT_SEND_TIME (numeric): Timestamp when the packet was sent
- PKT_RECEIVED_TIME (numeric): Timestamp when the packet was received
- FIRST_PKT_SENT (numeric): Timestamp of the first packet in a session
- LAST_PKT_RECEIVED (numeric): Timestamp of the last packet in a session
- PKT_CLASS (categorical): Classification label for the packet (Normal, UDP-Flood, Smurf, SIDDOS, HTTP-FLOOD)
```


## üß† Classification Task
The primary objective is to use the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify network traffic into one of the five categories based on the provided attributes. The dataset consists of both **numerical** and **categorical** features, requiring the following preprocessing steps:

- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling for numerical attributes
- Handling class imbalance (if necessary)

## üîç Potential Applications
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Detecting malicious activity in real-time.
- **Network Security Analysis**: Analyzing traffic to identify patterns and vulnerabilities.
- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Understanding the normal flow of traffic and identifying anomalies.
- **Cyberattack Mitigation**: Building systems to mitigate the effects of DDoS and other network-based attacks.

## üôè Acknowledgments
This dataset is provided for **research and educational purposes** in the fields of cybersecurity and machine learning. Proper attribution should be given when using the dataset in projects, research papers, or publications.
